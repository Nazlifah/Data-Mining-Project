# Data Mining Project
# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is developed as part of a data mining course, aiming to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. We compare the performance of four popular models: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes using the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

# Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features: Age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, etc.
- Target: Presence or absence of heart disease

# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

# Models Implemented
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

# Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Heatmaps for better visualization

| Model          | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------|
| Decision Tree  | 0.48     |
| SVM            | 0.57     |
| KNN            | 0.47     |
| Naive Bayes    | 0.58     |

# Confusion Matrix Highlights
- SVM had the highest correct predictions with 71.
- Naive Bayes followed with 66 correct predictions.
- KNN achieved 68 correct predictions.
- Decision Tree obtained 62 correct predictions.

# Conclusion
Naive Bayes gave the highest accuracy in this project (0.58), showing potential in handling this dataset. However, deeper feature engineering and model optimization could significantly improve results in the future.
